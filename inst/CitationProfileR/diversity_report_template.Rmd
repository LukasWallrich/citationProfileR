There are `r toString(params$f)` female names.  
There are `r toString(params$m)` male names.  
There are `r toString(params$i)` inconclusive names.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
 df <- data.frame(
       gender = c("Female", "Male", "Inconclusive"),
       count = c(params$f, params$m, params$i)
     )

 df$gender <- factor(df$gender, levels = df$gender)

ggplot(data=df, aes(x=gender, y=count)) +
   geom_bar(stat="identity")

<!-- The following diversity report is adapted from option 3 of *Citation Diversity Statement in BMES Journals* [@rowson2021citation]. -->
<!-- Recent work in several fields of science has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minority scholars are undercited relative to the number of papers in the field [@caplar2017quantitative, @dion2018gendered, @dworkin2020extent, @maliniak2013gender, @mitchell2013gendered]. Here, we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, race, ethnicity, and other factors. -->

<!-- First, we obtained the predicted gender of all authors of each reference by using the Gender-API to predict the gender of a person based on their first name. By this measure, our references contain `r toString(params$f)` female, `r toString(params$m)` male, and `r toString(params$i)` inconclusive names that the Gender-API was not able predict a gender. This method is limited in that a) names and pronouns used to train the Gender-API may not be inclusive, and the API may perform better on names from certain cultures than other, and b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people. -->

<!-- Second, we obtained locations, specifically in which country is the cited paper written, of all authors of each reference by using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) API and `countrycode` package. By this measure, the country that has largest count of authors is. This method is limited in that we have to rely on the OSM API and the `countrycode` package, and the information output by these two tool may be inaccurate. -->
